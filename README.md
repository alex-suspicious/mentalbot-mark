# To install dependencies
Just cd to the cloned repo, copy&paste it to the Terminal.
######
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages

# How to run it?
Just copy&paste this
######

# Installing?
You can install it as a systemd service, just run the install.sh file. 
You may need to chmod+x it.
Be aware that the directory you cloned the repo will be used in the service, so you will have a problem moving it if you're not familiar with systemd. So think twice where you want to put the bot in 🫶

    ./install.sh
